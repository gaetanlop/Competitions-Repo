* 03/03 : started feature engineering on 2 datatsets: season compact, seed 
* 04/03 : finished feature engineering -> Simple training set created
* 07/03 : built an inference pipeline and make one baseline submission (baseline is broken)
* 08/03 : reworked my baseline and make it work. Made one submission. Add rank feature.
* 09/03 : implemented features of this website: https://thepowerrank.com/cbb-analytics/
* 10/03 : built a KenPom scrapper from scratch using bs. Also created feature offensive efficiency
* 11/03 : build NCAAW pipeline + tried another way to increase the number of data points + hyperparameter tuning

=> Tried both ways to increase nb of winning matches + hyperparameter tuning on both.
