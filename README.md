# NCAA-competition

* 03/03 : started feature engineering on 2 datatsets: season compact, seed 
* 04/03 : finished feature engineering -> Simple training set created
* 07/03 : built an inference pipeline and make one baseline submission (baseline is broken)
* 08/03 : reworked my baseline and make it work. Made one submission. Add rank feature.
* 09/03 : implemented features of this website: https://thepowerrank.com/cbb-analytics/
* 10/03 : built a KenPom scrapper from scratch using bs. Also created feature offensive efficiency
* 11/03 : build NCAAW pipeline + tried another way to increase the number of data points + hyperparameter tuning
* 13/03 : NCAAW hyperparameter tuning
* 14/03 : NCAAW worked on feature selection, made the pipeline for 2021 predictions
* 15/03 : Everything ready for woman
* 16/03 : Everything ready for man. Just one notebook style in hyperparameter tuning. I scrapoped Kenpom data without leakage from 2011 to 2021.
* 17/03 : Add another column to kenpom data: adj_em. It seems that it is the most important features. I also maid my conservative submission. I am crezting my aggressive submission mostly based on kenpom data
* 18/03 : Create Spread notebook and tuned hyperparameters with optuna.


Tomorrow check spread competition. Take best params then submit.
